# Tiger-And-Goat-Puli-Meka-Game

Puli Meka, also known as "Tiger and Goats," is a strategic board game. It is a unique blend of chess and checkers, reflecting the traditional agrarian culture and folklore of the region. The game is played on a board, symbolizing a village or pasture, where two tigers are pitted against twenty three goats.

The objective of the tigers is to capture ten goats by jumping over them, akin to the moves in checkers. Conversely, the goal of the goats is to trap the tigers, preventing any of them from making valid moves. The game begins with the tigers and goats are placed on the board initially.

Players take turns to either place a goat on a vacant intersection or move a tiger to an adjacent position along the board lines. Tigers can jump over goats to capture them, but goats cannot jump over tigers or other goats. Strategic placement and movement are crucial as the game progresses, requiring foresight and tactical thinking from both players.

Winning Strategy for Tigers:

Early Aggression: Start capturing goats as soon as possible to reduce their numbers and mobility.
Corner Control: Use the corners to limit the goats' movement and create capture opportunities.
Coordination: Coordinate the movements of the tigers and capture goats, avoiding isolation of individual tigers.

Group Defense: Place goats in groups to form barriers, making it difficult for tigers to capture them.
Gradual Encirclement: Gradually encircle the tigers, restricting their movement and leading to a trap.
